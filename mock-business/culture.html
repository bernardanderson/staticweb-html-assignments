        <p><span class="culturerules">Rule #1 - No Silly Annual Reviews!</span>  At F.F. Woodycook's we don't want our workers to think of the "higher ups" with an US versus THEM mentality.  To combat this, we have no formal worker reviews. Workers are evaluated completely on a "High-Five" based system.

        <p><span class="culturerules">Rule #2 - Our Workers Are Special!</span>  We want all our workers to feel as if they are an important part of the F.F. Woodycook's team.  To make this happen, we've hired "Employee Attitude Adjusters (EAAs)" whose job it is to act as motivational support for each and every one of our employees.  Every day, each employee is congratulated and cheered on by the EAAs as they enter the workplace to start their mandatory 80 hour work week.

        <p><span class="culturerules">Rule #3 - The Workplace Should Be A Fun Place!</span>  We want all our employees to think of the workplace as having a loose, fun atmosphere.  We've hired special "Fun-gen-eers" to carefully anaylze each employee along with their workspaces to calculate the exact number of knick-knacks, bric-a-brack and momentos required to maximize their relaxedness-to-worker-output radio.  At our newest warehouse location, the Fun-gen-eers have pre-decorated each workspace so newly hired employees can be relieved of bringing in any personal belongings and get right down to working at maximum efficiency!
